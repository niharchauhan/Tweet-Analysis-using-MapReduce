**Tweet Analysis using MapReduce**

This project involves using Hadoop to analyze tweet data with MapReduce. Users will set up a local Hadoop environment, load tweet data into HDFS, and compile and run MapReduce applications. The tasks include determining the time of day when users most frequently tweet and when they likely go to sleep by analyzing tweets that contain the keyword "sleep." Results will be visualized as histograms showing tweet frequency by hour.
